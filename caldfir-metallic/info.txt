[DESCRIPTION:Custom metallic-palette for each vanilla metal.]

[STEAM_TITLE:Metallic]
[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:
The default metals all use flat color-palettes, and have a lot of repeats. This mod adds a unique palette for each metal-type, using various hues to simulate rust, reflections, and opalescence.

This will affect the visuals and color-descriptions for anything made of metal or the corresponding "native"-metal. Zero gameplay/balance changes.

This should generally (i)not(/i) conflict with mods that modify metal material properties or add new metals. This mod should probably occur after such mods in load-order.

This (b)WILL(/b) conflict with any other mods that add colors or modify the default palette.

Known Issues:

- dwarfs can have preferences for metallic-colors
- the metallic-colors are available in dye-mixing
- migrants and NPCs wear items dyed metallic-colors
- traders bring cloth dyed metallic-colors

*see caldfir_mundanic for a partial workaround*
