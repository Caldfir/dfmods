# DIVINE METALS

This mod contains an optional experimental fix for divine-metals. To enable
this feature:

- remove the underscore from the "divine" files under objects/
- in advanced worldgen, *disable* the "generated materials" option

This will replace the generated metals with the versions provided by this mod.
The stats should remain the same as the base-game, but your world will always
have *all* the materials present.


*Special thanks to **zippy38** for inspiring the divine-metal colors.*
