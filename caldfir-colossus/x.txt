Additions and enhancements to the Bronze Colossus. Adds alternate-caste versions of the Colossus for mid-tier alloys. Colossus now drops a special item (tool category) rather than a random statue. These "colossus parts" are quite valuable as a display-object, or can be melted to provide 300 bars of an appropriate metal. These alloys all melt in magma, so you'll only get the reward if you kill them the honest way ;-)

If you like the metallic colors, you can get them as a standalone mod (url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3161048506)HERE(/url).
