[NAME:Seasonish Crops (re-replace patch)]
[REQUIRES_ID_BEFORE_ME:re_replace_base]
[DESCRIPTION:Makes surface crops seasonal and 1 harvest per year with slightly increased yield, cave crops are perennial and 3 harvests per year with slightly decreased yield. If dead shrubs eventually clutter the surface after several years, using "plant remove -spd" with DFHack will remove them.]
