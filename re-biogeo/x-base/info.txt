[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:

(h3)Redone Biogeography(/h3)

- revises all plants and trees to make biomes more distinct
- sub-mods select creatures and plants up by regional availability circa 1400AD
- all vanilla plants and animals exist, but biome and entity availability are adjusted

- extended growth-duration for all crops (Seasonish Crops)
- many bugfixes for surface crops (Modest Plants)

(h3)Why?(/h3)

The game has a great selection of plants and animals, but *many* have their biome
set to NOT_FREEZING. This gives us a sort of gray-goo situation, where all the same
stuff is living everywhere. Now your coniferous forests are actually dominated by
conifers, wheat grows in grasslands and turnips grow in a marsh. This increases
the differences between embarks significantly.

I split things up by continent because koalas wandering through my quasi-medieval
fantasy setting is very distracting. 

(h3)Installation(/h3)

This is intended as a (b)full replacement(/b) for the vanilla plants and animals modules.
Remove vanilla creatures and plants modules. Place this mod after all the remaining vanilla modules.

You will need at least one of the sub-mods for region selection, but can install any combination:
- All: All the plants and animals. This will get you only the biome-redistribution.
- 23a: All the plants and animals from DF 23a (Boatmurdered).
- Magic: Totally fabricated or imaginary plants and animals.
- <continents>: All plants and animals naturalized to the continent circa 1400AD, plus animal-man and giant variants.

For a functional caverns, you will want Magic or 23a as a baseline. Add as many or as few continents as you want.

Dead shrubs may build-up on the surface when running this mod.
Th automate cleanup with DFHack:

```
