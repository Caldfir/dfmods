(b)YOU NEED TO DISABLE "GENERATED MATERIALS" IN ADVANCED WORLDGEN(/b)

Optional experimental addon to the base metallic mod that extends to the
divine metals. This is split out as a separate mod because it only works with
advanced-worldgen tinkering.

The divine (i)metals(/i) each have new unique palettes. Some look good.
Some look dumb. Focus was more on making them interesting than attractive.
Special thanks to (b)zippy38(/b) for the color baselines.

The divine (i)fabrics(/i) have their original colors restored, but do not have
the special metallic-only colors (this is just a bug workaround).
