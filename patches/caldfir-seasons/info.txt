[STEAM_TITLE:Modest Seasons]
[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:
This mod is a combination of "Seasonish Crops" and "Modest Plants". This combines a slower crop growth-rate with many bugfixes.

(h3)Installation(/h3)
This is intended as a (b)full replacement(/b) for the vanilla plants module. Slot this into your load-order where "Vanilla Plants" would normally go.

Dead shrubs may build-up on the surface when running this mod.
Th automate cleanup with DFHack:

(b)Dwarf Fortress/dfhack-config/init/onMapLoad.init(\b):
```
repeat --name seasonal-pruning --time 3 --timeUnits months --command [ plant remove -spd ]
```

I like both and now I don't have to choose!
