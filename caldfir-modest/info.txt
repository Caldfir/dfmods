[DESCRIPTION:Fixes for non-functional vanilla plants.]

[STEAM_TITLE:Modest Plants 2025]
[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:
The vanilla game-files contain many plants that are (variously) non-functional.
They either produce no seeds, or cannot be gathered, or produce seeds that cannot be used.
This mod intends to correct those issues so that these plants can be correctly gathered and farmed where appropriate.

(i)This mod is intended as a continuation of the modest-plants mod, which is not being maintained as of the 2025 dye updates.(/i)
